# Overview

Destroy all portals to clear the level and advance to the next one.

Enemies can destroy structures. If the player base is destroyed, you must restart the level.

New structures must be placed within range of existing player structures. This forms a connection between the new structure and the nearest existing one. A structure must directly or indirectly connect back to the player base. If that connection is lost, the structure will be destroyed.

Turrets can shoot at enemies and enemy portals if they have at most one other connection. They lose their ability to shoot when connected to a second structure, so be careful when placing multiple turrets near each other! They will regain their ability to shoot if enough connected structures are destroyed. They cannot be placed on pits.

Relays do not shoot at enemies but can be placed on pits.
